# **EcoNear - Google Solution Challenge**

The "EcoNear" project aims to create awareness about waste management and recycling by promoting climate action and responsible production and consumption. Approximately 2.01 billion tons of urban solid waste is generated worldwide each year, with at least a third of it not being managed in an environmentally sustainable manner. This situation not only damages ecosystems but also leads to water and soil pollution, reduces biodiversity, and has a direct link to climate change. To address this serious threat, our platform has been developed to raise awareness about household waste, taking a significant step towards a sustainable future.One of the primary goals of our project is to enable every individual to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable waste and to direct this waste to the appropriate recycling bins. To encourage this process, we provide our users with the opportunity to earn a financial reward for each unit of recycled waste. By promoting the reuse of recyclable materials, we aim to contribute to the development of a sustainable environmental awareness.

# **💻  ABOUT WASTE PAGE :**




This platform provides detailed information specific to each type of waste, enabling us to better understand the damage that waste causes to the environment. In this way, we can gain a comprehensive awareness of waste management and its environmental impact, while at the same time developing behaviors appropriate to the unique characteristics of each type of waste. Such an approach guides us in the proper segregation and treatment of waste, taking an important step towards a more sustainable and responsible society.

# **💻 DOMESTIC WASTE LIST PAGE :**






Our users can easily identify which of their waste is recyclable using our household waste list. Thanks to this list, waste with recycling potential will always be at the forefront of their consciousness, providing them with a strong guidance to contribute to the environment by making the right waste separation.

# **💻 LOCATION LIST PAGE :**
Our users can easily find their nearest waste collection point through our location list. Thanks to the Google Maps location of each point, they can reach the collection center of their choice smoothly and quickly, thus making their waste delivery process practical and efficient.

# **💻ECONEAR RECYCLE :**





Our advanced recycling system makes it easy for users to sort their waste by type. We have multiple recycling bins, each customized for different types of waste (electronics, plastic, paper, etc.). After selecting the appropriate bin for their waste, users log in by entering their ID and drop their waste in the relevant bin. After depositing the waste, the user receives a financial reward based on the weight of the waste deposited. This system encourages waste segregation, making recycling processes both efficient and rewarding.

# **💻 HOME PAGE & PROFİLE PAGE :**



On the profile page, our users can access their personal information and update this information at any time. In particular, with the updates made to the IBAN information field, users can easily transfer the financial rewards they earn on the homepage to the IBAN number they specify at any time. This feature personalizes the user experience, allowing them to manage their prize winnings in a simple and efficient way.

# **💻 TECHNOLOGIES WE USE :**



We chose Flutter for cross-platform user interface development and Firebase database for storing user data. We added Google Maps locations so that our users can easily find the collection sites. The integration of these technologies aims to provide our users with a seamless, interactive and knowledge-based experience.

# **💻Current / Next Steps :**

✅The primary goal of our project is based on the principles of climate action and responsible production and consumption, which are among the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

✅Users will earn money based on the type and amount of waste they dispose of.

✅The money earned can be transferred to the IBAN numbers listed in their profile section whenever they wish, or it can be used to purchase products offered by our project.

🎯We aim to simplify the identification of household waste through an object recognition system powered by artificial intelligence.

🎯Social Media Integration: We will introduce a social media integration that enables users to spread awareness about waste and engage with their friends through their social media accounts.

🎯Reward and Incentive Programs: To encourage users to consistently recycle their waste, we will offer reward and incentive programs. Incentives such as discount coupons or special rewards could be provided for recycling certain amounts of waste.

🎯Multilingual Support: We will provide support in various languages to ensure our platform can reach a broader audience.
